aenig4 - Enigma M4 Cipher Machine Emulator (Rosetta version)
============================================================

`aenig4` emulates the Enigma M4 cipher machine used by the U-boot division of
the German Navy during World War II. It can be used as well to emulate the
Enigma I machine (M1, M2, M3).

The original - and supported - software is written in C. The complete source
package with all the documentation, configure and install scripts can be found
at http://jorgicor.sdfeu.org/aenig4 .

This repository, on the other hand, contains the equivalent program, but
written in different programming languages (at this moment only in Oberon-07).

This is free software. See the file `COPYING` for copying conditions.
